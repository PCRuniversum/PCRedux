  abstract = {The analysis of different biomolecules is of prime importance for life science research and medical diagnostics. Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, VideoScan, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for PCR applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a HEp-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives VideoScan a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

  abstract = {Antibody assessment is an essential part in the serological diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. However, different diagnostic strategies have been proposed for the work up of sera in particular from patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD). In general, screening for SARD-associated antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is followed by confirmatory testing covering different assay techniques. Due to lacking automation, standardization, modern data management, and human bias in IIF screening, this two-stage approach has recently been challenged by multiplex techniques particularly in laboratories with high workload. However, detection of antinuclear antibodies by IIF is still recommended to be the gold standard method for antibody screening in sera from patients with suspected SARD. To address the limitations of IIF and to meet the demand for cost-efficient autoantibody screening, automated IIF methods employing novel pattern recognition algorithms for image analysis have been introduced recently. In this respect, the AKLIDES technology has been the first commercially available platform for automated interpretation of cell-based IIF testing and provides multiplexing by addressable microbead immunoassays for confirmatory testing. This paper gives an overview of recently published studies demonstrating the advantages of this new technology for SARD serology.},

  abstract   = {R is a free open-source implementation of the S statistical computing language and programming environment. The current status of R is a command line driven interface with no advanced cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI), but it includes tools for building such. Over the past years, proprietary and non-proprietary GUI solutions have emerged, based on internal or external tool kits, with different scopes and technological concepts. For example, Rgui.exe and Rgui.app have become the de facto GUI on the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms, respectively, for most users. In this paper we discuss RKWard which aims to be both a comprehensive GUI and an integrated development environment for R. RKWard is based on the KDE software libraries. Statistical procedures and plots are implemented using an extendable plugin architecture based on ECMAScript (JavaScript), R, and XML. RKWard provides an excellent tool to manage different types of data objects; even allowing for seamless editing of certain types. The objective of RKWard is to provide a portable and extensible R interface for both basic and advanced statistical and graphical analysis, while not compromising on flexibility and modularity of the R programming environment itself.},

  abstract = {Background:  DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most severe form of DNA damage in eukaryotic cells treated with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs. They can be quantitatively assessed by fluorescence imaging of phosphorylated histone protein H2AX (γH2AX), where the number of γH2AX foci represents the number of DNA DSB. Real-time assessment of DSB could help tailoring cytotoxic therapies to individual patients regarding both response and adverse events. This would require reliable automated quantification technology not yet routinely available. Here we explore this concept in the context of malignant lymphoma.
 Methods:  To investigate the DSB response to cytotoxic treatment  in vitro , peripheral lymphocytes of healthy donors were incubated with bendamustine, an alkylating drug commonly used in lymphoma therapy. To mimic the clinical setting, the drug concentration per number of donor cells was either calculated as a standard dose or based on the body surface area of the individual donor. DNA DSB were quantified by an automatized immunofluorescence γH2AX assay using the AKLIDES NUK {\textregistered}  system.
 Results:  Across all donors, the mean number of γH2AX foci per cell was 1.29, IQR (1.08) after bendamustine treatment as opposed to 0.04, IQR (0.125) in untreated freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The standardized incubation dosage resulted in a mean of 0.89, IQR (0.51) foci per cell, while individualized dose calculation yielded 1.57, IQR (0.5) foci per cell. The difference in γH2AX foci between the two dosage calculations was significant (P=0.036). In addition, we observed a trend towards a negative correlation between the donors{\rq} body surface area and the number of foci per cell. Between donors, no significant correlation of the number of foci in response to a given dose was observed. Dose titrations on the cells of individual donors demonstrated a significant response (P Conclusions:  The automatic AKLIDES analysis platform can assess γH2AX foci for routine use. The individual γH2AX foci response to  in vitro  bendamustine is dose-dependent and can be monitored timely. Calculating individual  in vitro  dosage from the donor{\rq}s body surface area resulted in a broad variation of foci counts between individuals, suggesting that this dosage method does not result in equivalent biological effects among different individuals. Adjusting the dose individually based on biological responses such as DNA DSB could offer a way of personalized medicine with conventional substances, reducing toxicity while increasing therapeutic efficacy.},

The individual variability of patients and their diverse responses to treatment options casts doubt on ``one-fits-all'' therapeutic strategies. Thus, biomarker-based stratification of patients into smaller cohorts is recommended. Indeed, the enormous progress in ``omics'' technologies has greatly supported this medical model which focused on determining disease predisposition, delivering early and targeted prevention, and/or tailoring the right therapy for each patient at the right time. Especially in the field of precision cancer therapy, the growing understanding of tumor heterogeneity and individual treatment responses has enabled the identification of adequate biomarkers.

	abstract = {The Generalized Hermite distribution (and the Hermite distribution as a particular case) is often used for fitting count data in the presence of overdispersion or multimodality. Despite this, to our knowledge, no standard software packages have implemented specific functions to compute basic probabilities and make simple statistical inference based on these distributions. We present here a set of computational tools that allows the user to face these difficulties by modelling with the Generalized Hermite distribution using the R package hermite. The package can also be used to generate random deviates from a Generalized Hermite distribution and to use basic functions to compute probabilities (density, cumulative density and quantile functions are available), to estimate parameters using the maximum likelihood method and to perform the likelihood ratio test for Poisson assumption against a Generalized Hermite alternative. In order to improve the density and quantile functions performance when the parameters are large, Edgeworth and Cornish-Fisher expansions have been used. Hermite regression is also a useful tool for modeling inflated count data, so its inclusion to a commonly used software like R will make this tool available to a wide range of potential users. Some examples of usage in several fields of application are also given.},

  abstract = {Analysis of phosphorylated histone protein H2AX (γH2AX) foci is currently the most sensitive method to detect DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). This protein modification has the potential to become an individual biomarker of cellular stress, especially in the diagnosis and monitoring of neoplastic diseases. To make γH2AX foci analysis available as a routine screening method, different software approaches for automated immunofluorescence pattern evaluation have recently been developed. In this study, we used novel pattern recognition algorithms on the AKLIDES® platform to automatically analyze immunofluorescence images of γH2AX foci and compared the results with visual assessments. Dose- and time-dependent γH2AX foci formation was investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide (ETP). Moreover, the AKLIDES system was used to analyze the impact of different immunomodulatory reagents on γH2AX foci formation in PBMCs. Apart from γH2AX foci counting the use of novel pattern recognition algorithms allowed the measurement of their fluorescence intensity and size, as well as the analysis of overlapping γH2AX foci. The comparison of automated and manual foci quantification showed overall a good correlation. After ETP exposure, a clear dose-dependent increase of γH2AX foci formation was evident using the AKLIDES as well as Western blot analysis. Kinetic experiments on PBMCs incubated with 5 μM ETP demonstrated a peak in γH2AX foci formation after 4 to 8 h, while a removal of ETP resulted in a strong reduction of γH2AX foci after 1 to 4 h. In summary, this study demonstrated that the AKLIDES system can be used as an efficient automatic screening tool for γH2AX foci analysis by providing new evaluation features and facilitating the identification of drugs which induce or modulate DNA damage. © 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

  abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical cellular lesions that represent a high risk for genetic instability. DSBs initiate repair mechanisms by recruiting sensor proteins and mediators. DSB biomarkers, like phosphorylated histone 2AX (γH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), are detectable by immunofluorescence as either foci or distinct patterns in the vicinity of DSBs. The correlation between the number of foci and the number of DSBs makes them a useful tool for quantification of DNA damage in precision medicine, forensics and cancer research. The quantification and characterization of foci ideally uses large cell numbers to achieve statistical validity. This requires software tools that are suitable for the analysis of large complex data sets, even for users with limited experience in digital image processing. This includes, for example, pre-processing, transformation and presentation of the data in a less complex structure for further data analysis. There are numerous software solutions for the analysis of foci. This review gives an overview of open source image processing software packages, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as CellProfiler, Icy and ImageJ/Fiji. Software packages like CellProfiler and Icy enable to gain high-content information about DSB biomarkers. Programming languages, like Python, are discussed briefly.},

  abstract = {In previous research, significant effects of weather conditions on car crashes have been found. However, most studies use monthly or yearly data and only few studies are available analyzing the impact of weather conditions on daily car crash counts. Furthermore, the studies that are available on a daily level do not explicitly model the data in a time-series context, hereby ignoring the temporal serial correlation that may be present in the data. In this paper, we introduce an integer autoregressive model for modelling count data with time interdependencies. The model is applied to daily car crash data, metereological data and traffic exposure data from the Netherlands aiming at examining the risk impact of weather conditions on the observed counts. The results show that several assumptions related to the effect of weather conditions on crash counts are found to be significant in the data and that if serial temporal correlation is not accounted for in the model, this may produce biased results.},

  abstract   = {Recurrent events in clinical trials have typically been analysed using either a multiple time-to-event method or a direct approach based on the distribution of the number of events. An area of application for these methods is exacerbation data from respiratory clinical trials. The different approaches to the analysis and the issues involved are illustrated for a large trial (n = 1465) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For exacerbation rates, clinical interest centres on a direct comparison of rates for each treatment which favours the distribution-based analysis, rather than a time-to-event approach. Poisson regression has often been employed and has recently been recommended as the appropriate method of analysis for COPD exacerbations but the key assumptions often appear unreasonable for this analysis. By contrast use of a negative binomial model which corresponds to assuming a separate Poisson parameter for each subject offers a more appealing approach. Non-parametric methods avoid some of the assumptions required by these models, but do not provide appropriate estimates of treatment effects because of the discrete and bounded nature of the data.},
